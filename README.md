# G'day

I am a technical communicator‚Äîcurrently working remote, asynchronous and distributed (RAD! üòé). I'm based in Melbourne, Australia.

I work as a technical editor and writer at [Open Strategy Partners](https://openstrategypartners.com/), a strategic communications agency. I love being a part of this team, where I can [write and speak](https://openstrategypartners.com/how-we-write-and-edit-at-osp-podcast-s1e1) about writing and editing.  


### Open source

I am a member of the [TYPO3 Association](https://typo3.org/), an open source CMS. I contribute to that project in the [Content Team](https://typo3.org/community/teams/content). This is a great community. If you're looking for a CMS I can highly recommend it!

In 2019, I helped found [The Good Docs Project](https://gitlab.com/tgdp), creating best practice templates and writing instructions for documenting open source software. It's heaps cool over there - you should totally check it out.
