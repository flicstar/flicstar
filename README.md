# G'day

I am a technical communicatorâ€”currently working remote, asynchronous and distributed (RAD! ðŸ˜Ž). I'm based in Melbourne, Australia. 


### Day Job

I work as a technical editor and writer at [Open Strategy Partners](https://openstrategypartners.com/), a strategic communications agency. I love being a part of this team, where I can [write and speak](https://openstrategypartners.com/how-we-write-and-edit-at-osp-podcast-s1e1) about writing and editing.  


### Open source

I am a member of the [TYPO3 Association](https://typo3.org/), an open source CMS. I contribute to that project in the [Documentation Team](https://typo3.org/community/teams/documentation) and [Content Team](https://typo3.org/community/teams/content). This is a great community. If you're looking for a CMS I can highly recommend it! I co-authored [The TYPO3 Guidebook](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484265246), published January 2021.

I'm involved with [The Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/), creating best practice templates and writing instructions for documenting open source software. I review templates and write for the [blog](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/blog/). It's heaps cool over there - you should totally come and join us.

I write about technical editing over on [Hashnode](https://flicstar.hashnode.dev/).
